# Task Manager 
A simple application that allows users to keep track of their day-to-day tasks.
There is a user and login system as well as the ability to edit existing tasks and generate statistical reports.

## Instructions
The program does not need to be installed, simply copy the task_mangager.py into an empty directory,
the associated text files will be automatically generated.

The program is commandline based, simply follow the onscreen menu to navigate the application.

Enter the menu option you wish to go to and press enter. 

## Capstone Project - Lists, Functions and String Handling

+ Use the task_manager.py file, together with the supporting text files
user.txt and tasks.txt for this Capstone project. In this task, you will be
modifying task_manager.py to extend its functionality. Working on
existing code files to extend them is great practice for working in a
developer team on an established code base.

+ You will notice that the main body of the code requires functionality for
registering a user, adding a task, viewing all tasks, and viewing the current
user's tasks. However, because there is so much functionality needed to
complete this, the main body of the loop becomes difficult to read. Using
the principle of abstraction, refactor the code to create and use the
following functions:

- reg_user — a function that is called when the user selects ‘r’ to
register a user.
- add_task — a function that is called when a user selects ‘a’ to add a
new task.
- view_all — a function that is called when users type ‘va’ to view all
the tasks listed in ‘tasks.txt’.
- view_mine — a function that is called when users type ‘vm’ to view
all the tasks that have been assigned to them.
